B(FOM)^2 [1][2] is a versatile package implementing restarted block FOM 
methods for approximating the action of a matrix function on multiple 
vectors, i.e., f(A)B. The main purpose is to study the behavior of such 
methods for different parameter choices on different kinds of problems. 
The papers cited below are introductions to a new framework for the 
analysis of block Krylov methods, in particular B(FOM)^2 and its 
modifications. Linear systems solvers are also included, as they inform 
the matrix function solvers.
